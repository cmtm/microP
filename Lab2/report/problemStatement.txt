We were tasked with implementing a piece of software that runs on the microcontroller. This software can be in two states: one where the LEDs flash and the other where they displays the internal chip temperature. The mode is switched with a button press. The flashing mode consists of the LEDs toggling at a fixed speed (slow enough to be visible). In temperature display mode, the internal chip temperature is converted to a number in the range of 0-4 and the 4 LEDs are set to represent this value.

The main challenge was picking the ideal filter depth. From a software engineering perspective, this was a simple application.
